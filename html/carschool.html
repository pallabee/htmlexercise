                instructor, good online information and lots of encouragement to ‘practise, practise, practise’.

              <p style="color:#848484"> Our mission at Easy Street Driving School is to provide each student with a solid foundation of knowledge and skills to help them become a safe, responsible, and confident driver. Easy Street Driving School strives to promote in each of
                our students the attitudes associated with a safe and successful life-long driving experience. Patience and respect serve as the model of our teaching; we understand that each person is unique and Easy Street Driving School moves to provide
                individual instruction (smaller class size) in order to meet the demands of today’s ever changing and challenging driving environment.

              <p style="color:#848484">Road safety is a key concern area for both the Government and the people on Indian roads. Safe driving today requires a higher level of confidence and competence, given the poor traffic planning, increasing number of vehicles, lack of professionalism
                in driving and untrained drivers on road. In a bid to address these issues, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. has launched Maruti Driving School — its initiative for promoting safe driving. MDS not just imparts better driving skills but also tries
                to inculcate safe driving culture through special theoretical sessions for behavioural training and road sense. The school was the first to introduce advanced driving training simulator for better judgment and concept of route maps for
                holistic on-road practice.

            <p> MDS has very good instructors and theory classes are just awesome!!! It is a must know for every driver on the road. With the knowledge of "Emergency Handling techniques" alone, my vehicle did not get damaged in heavy rain with roads flooded.
              They have a progress record for each student with the topics to teach (like reverse, overtake, lane changing, moving to 3rd, 4th & 5th Gear, Parking, etc). I am very satisfied with their trainings and theories, they even teach the behavioral
              attitude one should have while on the road!! Our roads would have been far better if all the road users knew about these. The entire course might look little expensive, but believe me, it¿s worth each penny you spend.

            <p> Concept of MDS is the need of the hour, especially for the ladies. MDS (Jabalpur) is managed by good professional people who are knowledgeable, courteous, polite and patient. I would definitely recommend MDS to my friends and relatives.
